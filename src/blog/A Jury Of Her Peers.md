# Writing Analysis

*A Jury of Her Peers*, a short story by the early 20th century writer Susan Glaspell shows both the cause of the American feminsit movement and acts of rebellion aganist women's lowered status in American society.

The plot is driven by two women Mrs. Hale, a neighboring farmers wife, and Mrs. Peters, the sheriff's wife, who over the course of the short story discover the true nature of the murder of Mr. Wright by his wife Mrs. Wright. The husband's of these two women ineffectively investigate the crime scene while belittling the two women as they collect Mrs. Wright's belongings. Ironically, the men learn nothing important from the crime scene while the women see evidence around the house that shows Mrs. Wright murdered her husband in response to his abuse. Faced with this knowledge both confirming the accused as a murderer and as a sympathetic victim the women have to choose whether to report the evidence to the men. At the very end of the novel the women choose to not condemn Mrs. Wright to the murder of her husband.

Susan Glaspell story's is inspired by an event that she reported on earlier in her life for a newspaper in Iowa. The actual event featured a woman who was accused of murdering her husband and was eventually convicted to life imprisonment[1]. As a result of this trial Glaspell stopped her career as a journalist and moved toward narrative writing. This piece that digs up a rough piece of Susan's past is retold in a way to give sympathy to the accussed and show how that women are entirely justified in their belief that they are marginalized in society.

This story that justifies murder, paints two women as wise, and shows men as ignorant fools came in the wake of America's first feminist wave. It was published in 1917 a meer three years before the passage of the 19th amendment and must have been to used as a tool to show  those doubtful of women's plight why women were seeking increased representation. Arguments that women should remain reliant on their husbands will have a hard time overcoming the consequences of ignoring women's input that this story so vividly shows.

I think this narrative was extremely powerful because it demonstrated the cause of American feminist's and the true justice they seek.
