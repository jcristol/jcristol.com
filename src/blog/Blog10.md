## Social Medias

Over the past year I have been present on several social media platforms. ðŸ˜“



#### Snapchat

I use Snapchat to visually stay connected to friends who I cannot see in person. The snaps I send to people have very little actual content in them. They usually consist of a stupid message laid over my goofy face.

I am trying to reduce my Snapchat time especially since their new update does not encourage passive use.

#### Facebook

I don't feel like the average Facebook user. I mainly use it to as a photo store, birthday tracker, or my own personal snooping software

I have a bad habit of opening Facebook as soon as I start up Chrome. I usually don't stay very long but it can be long enough to see a post that might upset me. Facebook has the most toxic content at the top of your newsfeed.

#### Facebook Messanger

I use messaging applications the most out of all social media platforms. As an application Messenger is really polished. However, I feel like its main purpose is to pull people onto the main platform. 

Considering I don't want to be on the main platform I am trying to cut out messenger. I am moving all my chats to Discord.

#### Discord

The only platform I hold in a completely positive light. I use Discord exclusively for a chat and messaging platform. 

#### Reddit

Days of my life have been sacrificed to Reddit. At the beginning of the year I had to quit it cold turkey. 

Reddit was effecting my reading comprehension and attention span. Reddit practically spoon feeds you dopamine and doesn't force you to read articles. Before I started using Reddit I could finish and enjoy a book about once a month. After chronic use I stopped reading and I got bored much more easily. It was the right choice for me to move off of the platform.
