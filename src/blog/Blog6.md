## The Internet is a Marketplace

This idea is held by many people who follow today's American Conservative ideology. The goal of a marketplace is to facilitate an environment where the best companies for consumers and businesses survive.

Where and why has this idea of the Internet broken down. For one the Internet unfortunately isn't a decentralized and large marketplace owned by many competing entities, most of the internet infrastructure is owned by a few large Internet Service Providers ***(ISP)***. In this FCC graph in 2013[1] you can see that almost 70% of American's have the choice of two or fewer ISP's and around 30% out of the 70% have a single choice. With the continuing trends of merger's and acquisitions among the large ISP's these numbers in 2018 are surely worse for competition[2]. With this anti-competitive marketplace ISP's can make changes to how internet service is priced and what the experience of the internet is like without seeing a revenue backlash. More concretely, this anti-competitive power that ISPs have can allow them to throttle performance of certain services that they compete with and boost performance of their own services. A good example of a theoretical battle could be Netflix versus Hulu. Hulu, a service owned by the ISP Comcast, would be prioritized for speed and cost and Netflix would be too expensive and hard to get for consumers. ISPs could also limit access to information that we see as basic necessity today. Imagine what it would be like to have to pay for a subscription to Wikipedia. While these scenario's might not play out as soon as this year do you really trust companies to prioritize the protection of consumer's and other companies bottom line over their own profits. 

The real bottom line is that the Internet unfortunately is not a regular marketplace and shouldn't be regulated like one. The Internet and the information on it should be protected and regulated by the government.

The only solution I see barring the Internet marketplace becoming way more competitive is to reinstate Net Neutrality rules.
