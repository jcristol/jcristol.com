## The Internet is a Marketplace

This idea is held by many people who follow today's American Conservative ideology. The goal of a marketplace is to facilitate an environment where only the best companies survive.

Why can't the Internet be viewed this way? Unfortunately, the Internet isn't a decentralized and diverse marketplace owned by many competing entities, most of the internet infrastructure is owned by a few large Internet Service Providers ***(ISP)***. In this FCC graph in 2013[1] you can see that almost 70% of American's have two or fewer ISP's to choose from and around 30% out of the 70% have a single choice. With the continuing trends of merger's and acquisitions among the large ISP's these numbers in 2018 are surely worse for competition[2]. 

With this anti-competitive marketplace ISP's can make changes to how internet service is priced and what the experience of the Internet is like without seeing a revenue backlash. More concretely, this anti-competitive power that ISPs have can allow them to throttle performance of certain services that they compete with and boost performance of their own services. 

A good example of a theoretical battle could be Netflix versus Hulu. Hulu, a service owned by the ISP Comcast, would be prioritized for speed and cost and Netflix would be too expensive and hard to get for consumers. ISPs could also limit access to information that we see as basic necessity today. Imagine what it would be like to have to pay for a subscription to Wikipedia. While these scenario's might not play out as soon as this year , ISP's will most likely role out anti-competitive policies at a slow creep to not bother consumer's or the news media.

The real bottom line is that the Internet unfortunately is not a regular marketplace and shouldn't be regulated like one. The Internet and the information on it should be protected and regulated by the government. The only solution to this problem is to reinstate Net Neutrality rules.
