## Addiction Online

It is hard to come up with a metric that tells us whether our century is more addictive or less addictive then the previous. However, I certainly feel like many people myself included are constantly plugged into a digital world where there is constant stimulation. One of the many downsides of this constant stimulation is not being able to experience boredom. Boredom surprisingly is an important part of mental health and helps stimulate creativity and activity. Other side effects of this new reality are just starting to be understood and here I would like to talk about several websites that I think have shirked their responsibilities and have built business models around addiction.

#### Facebook

The big FB. Facebook is in a lot of hot water right now for allowing people's personal data to be slurped up so freely by anyone conducting a "research" study. What isn't catching headlines is how Facebook is built around user addiction. Facebook has over 2 billion users. Barring China lifting its ban on Facebook it is nearly impossible for this company to grow its user base more. Realizing this Facebook's future growth strategy has been entirely focused on building mechanics in the website that try and keep people on Facebook longer. This is why Facebook diversified to video and changed its rank algorithm to bring more media to your newsfeed. Originally this website was simply trying to connect you to your friends better. But now it has turned into the largest platform that serves media content online. 

####  Reddit

I spent roughly 5 years engaged on Reddit however over that time period I found myself spending more and more time on the website and app. I found myself in almost every instance of downtime on the bus, before class, in the morning, before bed entertaining myself by looking at what people where talking about on Reddit. I am sure this pattern of use is not unique to me. I hear from many friends that they spend too much time on this platform and that it is distracting when trying to accomplish any work. It and many other similar sites have become such a big distractions that people have made apps that allow users to self impose reddit restrictions and reward users for not using popular websites. 

#### Impact

These websites and others aren't inherently bad. However I think that certain mechanics that have been baked into these websites such as the newsfeed algorithm in Facebook and the endless scroll in Reddit have led to addictive behavior. I think these companies need to embrace their responsibility and start changing their platforms so they don't cause irreversible harm on society.
