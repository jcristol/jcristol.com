## Virtue Based Ethics

Virtue based ethical systems focus on the development of character instead of making a system to determine action. Virtue based systems charaterize the traits a "good"[1] person should have and call these traits virtues. The belief of followers of this system is that those who adopt these virtues will take good actions and choose good outcomes.

#### History

The virtue based system of ethics originate from the ancient Greek schools of thought established by the great Greek Philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. This school of thought established key virtues that people must abide by to become good individuals. As stated in Plato's Republic there are four cardinal virtues that people should aspire to attain; wisdom, justice, fortitude, and temperance[2]. Although these four values are positive characteristics there are no rules that establish them as the true indicators of a moral individual. This flaw and other flaws of a virtue system are discussed in the Head Scratchings section later in the blog post.

Today the true "origins" of Virtue Based Ethics are being increasingly contested. Ancient Chinese scholars such as Confucious studied the implications of similar ethical systems that focused on people adopting traits to improve themselves. Although it is important to consider the historical foundations of this ethical system, I believe virtue based ethics is an inherent part of human nature.

#### Applications

If you find yourself in a self help seminar or in front of Tony Robbins you will be exposed to a form of a virtue based ethical system. It is a common tactic of self help organizations to encourage the adoption of virtues. Sometimes these virtues come in the form of an ideal self image or words projected behind a inspirational speaker. This form of encouraging personal adoption of traits is a perfect example of virtue based systems in action.

#### Head Scratchings

Virtue based systems are too hopeful in assuming adoption of moral virtues leads to moral actions and outcomes. Yes, the system gives aspirational goals but it doesn't give any real help to those who find themselves in the middle of a hard decision. Help from the virtue of wisdom might not come in the moment of making a risky investment or figuring out what to say to a loved one. 

Beyond having little practical help in making decisions virtue systems are flawed by those who create the virtues. Though Plato's four virtues seem generally good, I think no one even Plato can know what makes a good moral person. Just following Plato's virtues could potentially limit you from achieveing your full moral potential. The virtues tend to vary among different beliefs which makes it impossible to have a consistent set of rules to abide by to be moral.

However, their are positives to this type of ethical system. It is easy to comprehend and communicate a virtue based system. It is easy to communicate to be wise, just, and patient. Other ethical system focus more on developing behaviors over longs periods of time. Virtues give people very concrete goals that are easy to look at and examine.
